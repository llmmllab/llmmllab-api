"""
Composer Service Interface Layer.

Provides the public API boundary for the composer component, enabling other
services to interact with composer functionality while maintaining strict
architectural decoupling. This interface abstracts LangGraph workflow
construction, execution, and state management.

Interface Functions:
- initialize_composer(): Service lifecycle management
- compose_workflow(): Create executable LangGraph workflows using user_id and messages
- create_initial_state(): Generate workflow state from user_id and messages
- execute_workflow(): Stream-enabled workflow execution
- get_composer_config(): Runtime configuration access

Architectural Role:
- Defines clean API boundaries between components
- Abstracts internal composer implementation details
- Enables dependency injection for external services
- Maintains Protocol-based decoupling requirements
